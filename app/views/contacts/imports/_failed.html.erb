  We had some trouble importing that vCard.
</h1>

<p class="flush--top">
  This is usually because the file was formatted incorrectly,
  or it had too many contacts for us to process.
</p>

<section class="list--warning push--bottom">
  <p><strong>To fix this, try the following...</strong></p>
  <ol class="align--left">
    <li>Double check that the file contains at least one contact with an email address.</li>
    <li>Re-export the file and try importing it into HEY again.</li>
  </ol>
</section>
